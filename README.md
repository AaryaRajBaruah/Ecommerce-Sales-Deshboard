This is an end to end project on Power Bi Deshboard
I have created my first Power BI Dashboard representing the analysis of e-commerce sales data .

Project Learnings:

• Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data 
• Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
• Created connections, join new tables, calculations to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations
• Used different types . of customized visualization (bar chart, pie chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc.) 
The below Dashboard shows the total Profit earned by the store and the total quantity sold yearly; the column chart shows the monthly profit; clustered bar charts are used to show the top 5 subcategories; stacked column charts are used for customers; the donut chart is used to show the payment mode and quantity of the products; and the slicer of the quarter shows quarterly data values.
